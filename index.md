One of the oldest sources of datasets on the web, and a great first 
stop when looking for interesting datasets. Although the data sets are 
user-contributed, and thus have varying levels of cleanliness, 
the vast majority are clean. You can download data directly from 
the UCI Machine Learning repository, without registration.


* [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch): 
 Thanks to Google’s acquisition of Schema.org the metadata for datasets 
 is now recognized by Google’s knowledge graph.  This is in beta

* [Google Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets/): 
Public Datasets on Google Cloud Platform makes it easy for users to access 
and analyze data in the cloud. These datasets are freely hosted and 
accessible using a variety of data warehouse and analytics software, 
from open source Apache Spark to cutting edge Google technologies 
like Google BigQuery and Google Cloud Dataflow. From structured genomic 
or encyclopedic data to unstructured climate data, Public Datasets provide 
a playground for those new to big data and data analysis and a powerful 
repository for skilled researchers. You can also integrate with your 
application to add valuable insights for your users. Whatever your use case, 
these datasets are freely available on GCP.


* [Microsoft Research Open Data](https://msropendata.com/): 
A collection of free datasets from Microsoft Research to advance 
state-of-the-art research in areas such as natural language processing,

to a cloud-based Data Science Virtual Machine for a seamless development 
experience. Categpries include Biology, Engineering, Healthcare, Mathematics,
Social Science, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Information Science and Physics.
MS Research Open Data doesn’t search the entire web, but rather makes available 
53 previously proprietary datasets all in the realm of deep learning, both 
text/speech and image.


* [Academic Torrents](http://academictorrents.com/):
